# 🍦 Cold Licks — My First Web Development Project

**Cold Licks** is a fully responsive and visually joyful ice-cream shopping website made using **HTML & CSS**.  
It’s my **first ever web development project**, created to practice structure, layout design, and responsive styling while keeping everything creative and colorful.

## 🌈 Overview

This website is designed to showcase different ice-cream flavors like Chocolate, Strawberry, Butterscotch, and Vanilla — each displayed in clean, modern product cards.  
It features a header with navigation icons, a search bar, and a footer that resembles a real e-commerce layout.

The goal of this project was to learn:
- How to structure a website using semantic HTML  
- How to design visually appealing layouts using pure CSS  
- How to make websites look good on all screen sizes

## 🛠️ Project Status

🚧 **In Development**

This is the **first version**, built using just **HTML & CSS**.  
As I continue learning **JavaScript** and more advanced web development, I plan to add:

- 🛒 Add to Cart & Product Quantity System  
- 🔍 Functional Search Bar  
- 👤 User Login and Profile System  
- 🧠 Interactive Animations  
- 💻 Maybe a small backend later using Node.js / Express  

So the project will keep evolving as I grow as a developer.
